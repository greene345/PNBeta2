Here is a list of informative guides and tutorials about how to play the game. The links are organized by category.

<h2>Cities</h2>
In Pixel Nations, every nation has <b>Cities</b>. Cities are the main components of your nation, and they consist of four zone types, as well as <b>Land</b>. Land is used to lower population density, but other than that it has no use. Cities can also be upgraded by adding <b>Services</b>.
<br />
<h3>Residential Zones</h3>
Residential Zones increase a city's population. Each Residential Zone will increase the population by 10,000 people. Residential Zones also increase the <b>Unemployment Rate</b> and also slightly increase the <b>Crime Rate</b>.
<br />
<h3>Commercial Zones</h3>
Commercial Zones decrease a city's <b>Unemployment Rate</b>. They slightly increase the <b>Crime Rate</b> as well.
<br />
<h3>Industrial Zones</h3>
Industrial Zones decrease a city's <b>Unemployment Rate</b> slightly more than Commercial Zones, but also increase the <b>Crime Rate</b> more as well as adding to a city's <b>Pollution</b>.
<br />
<h3>Civic Zones</h3>
Civic Zones decrease a city's <b>Crime Rate</b> as well as reducing <b>Pollution</b>.
<br /> 
<h3>Services</h3>
Cities can also be upgraded through services which have static affects on the stats of a city. Services like <b>Police Stations</b> will lower the crime rate, while <b>Landfills</b> and <b>Sanitation Plants</b> will lower pollution. <b>Libraries</b> and <b>Universities</b> will increase the <b>Literacy Rate</b>.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Happiness</h2>
National Happiness is an average of all of your cities' happiness. Happiness itself is determined by the <b>Crime Rate</b>, <b>Unemployment Rate</b>, <b>Literacy Rate</b> and <b>Population Density</b> of a city. There are other factors that can affect happiness as well, such as having a high <b>Tax Rate</b>, <b>Events</b>, and <b>Resources</b>.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Average Income</h2>
Average Income is the amount of money that your citizens are making per hour. The game isn't so inflated like the real world, so your citizens will likely be making around <b>$1.00</b>. That is normal. Average income is affected by <b>Happiness</b>, as well as sometimes <b>Marvels</b>, <b>Resources</b>, and <b>Events</b>. Having a high average income means you will make more money. You can collect taxes from your citizens on the <b>Budget</b> page.
<br />
<br />
<h2>Resources</h2>
Resources are the key to the economics of Pixel Nations. Each city has a resource, and will produce 10 of it per hour. You can collect these resources on the <b>Budget</b> page. Your nation will also spend one of each resource per city per hour. For example, if you have 5 cities, you will spend 5 of every resource per hour. Resources can't go negative, so if you don't have a resource it will remain at zero.
<br />
Each resource has different benefits, and some are more rare than others. Resources can be traded through <b>Shipments</b> and the global <b>Market</b>.

<br /><br />
<h2>Research</h2>
Research is another way to advance your nation technologically. Research Items last forever, and will provide benefits to your nation. To research more technology, you must first acquire <b>Research Points</b>. Research Points are produced by the city services <b>Universities</b> and <b>Research Labs</b>. They are collected on the <b>Budget</b> page and spent on the Research page.
<br /><br />
<h2>Marvels</h2>
Marvels are great national acheivements and upgrades. They cannot be destroyed once built, and will continously provide benefits for your nation. Marvels are usually very expensive, and not cost-effective to obtain until you have a large nation.
<br /><br />
<h2>Wars</h2>
War is an aspect every nation has to deal with. If you go to your Policies page, you can switch to being a "peaceful" nation and you won't be able to be attacked, but you will suffer severe income penalties.

<h3>Ground Attacks</h3>
Ground attacks are battles fought on land by infantry and vehicles. The winner of the battle will steal a random amount of money based on their opponent's casualties. If the defending army is especially weak, the attacker can raid the defending nation for Research Points and extra money, as well as destroying city zones and stealing land.
<br />
<h4>Infantry</h4>
There are three types of infantry units, <b>Soldiers</b>, <b>Snipers</b>, and <b>Paratroopers</b>. Soldiers are the cheapest and good overall units, Snipers are slightly better at offense, and Paratroopers are great offensive units.
<br />
<h4>Vehicles</h4>
There are three types of vehicles, <b>Nomads</b>, <b>Mavericks</b>, and <b>Longhorns</b>. Nomads are highly mobile lightly armored jeep type vehicles, Mavericks are like lightly armored tanks, and Longhorns are heavily armored tanks that excel at defense.
<br />
<h3>Aerial Attacks</h3>
Aerial attacks are fought in the sky by aircraft as well as SAM Batteries on the ground. There are four units used in Aerial attacks, <b>Fighter Jets</b>, <b>Interceptors</b>, <b>Bombers</b>, and <b>SAM Batteries</b>. If the attacking nation wins an aerial battle, depending on the amount of bombers they have they will destroy some of their opponent's city zones.
<br />
<h3>Naval Attacks</h3>
Naval attacks are fought at sea by ships and submarines. There are four units used in Naval attacks, <b>Battleships</b>, <b>Destroyers</b>, <b>Submarines</b>, and <b>Carriers</b>. Destroyers are good defensive ships while Carriers are great offensive ships. If the attacker of a naval battle wins, they can destroy enemy city zones depending on the number of Carriers they have.
<br />
<h3>Ballistic Missiles</h3>
Ballistic Missiles are devastating rockets that destroy up to 50 zones in an enemies' city of your choice.
<br />
<h3>Nuclear Weapons</h3>
Nuclear Weapons are extremely devastating weapons that will completely destroy an enemy city of your choice. They cannot be purchased while at war.
